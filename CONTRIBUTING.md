The code is in a pretty messy state after a rushed first release, but will become much more modular and well-documented over time.
Issues are categorized into levels of difficulty amongst other properties, but the ones flagged with "Assistance Welcome" are most likely to be tackleable by outside contributors.
Pull requests of any kind are welcome, but there is no defined process or acceptance criteria yet, we'll just figure it out along the way.
