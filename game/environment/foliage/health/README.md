# Plant Health

## Prior Art & Inspiration

* [Stoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoma) (Wikipedia) - Plants "breathe" gases (CO2 and Oxygen) through stomata
* [Tree Spacing](http://hort.ifas.ufl.edu/woody/spacing.shtml) (University of Florida: Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, Environmental Horticulture - Urban planning)

## Philosophy

A plant in good health is distinct from an unhealthy or dying plant

* Only healthy plants reproduce successfully.

Factors contributing to a plant's health:
- Food/Soil Health
  - Soil health, i.e. Nutrients and Fertilizers
  - Pollution levels (Water, Ground, & Air)
  - Water availability and quality
    - Climate's propensity to keep the soil wet (e.g. wetter in rainforests)
    - Ground water
    - _Water Pollution_
  - _Air Pollution_
    - Air pollution may not be a detriment to a plant's health if that pollution contains a lot of carbon dioxide
- Available sunlight
  - Neighboring plants, "Crowdedness" in three dimensions
  - Groundcover likes shade
  - Trees like lone canopies and to be farther part from each other (See Tree Spacing in [Prior Art & Inspiration](#prior-art--inspiration))
- Heat

**Questions**

- What kinds of air pollution is bad for plants?
- Does humidity affect plants? Doesn't high humidity promote the growth of fungi?
- How do Cacti fit in?
- How long before an unhealthy plant dies?
- Should plants be subject to disease? (e.g. fungus or parasites)
