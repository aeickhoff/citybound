# Foliage Interaction

## Prior Art & Inspiration

## Philosophy

### Planting Foliage

Roads sketching with specified green medians or green strips next to sidewalks shall automatically plant foliage.
* Let the player decide on mixtures of trees, shrubs and bushes, flowers, etc.

These zone types plant foliage automatically for the player:
* Agricultural (plants are annual/seasonal)
* Residential
* Offices
* Parks and Plazas
  * Parks can make use of existing foliage

Zones have user-configurable properties for green space allotments and plant types.

### Uprooting Foliage

* Construction in the city will uproot (bulldoze) foliage
* Uprooted trees may be sent to a city's _Logging_ industry for use in Wood products

#### Transplanting Uprooted Foliage

* Uprooted foliage may be transplanted to a city's Parks or to other empty green spaces
* A plant may only be moved to a new location if a new location satisfied the following requirements:
  * Available space is large enough to hold the plant
    * Land is clear
    * Area above land is clear of obstructions
      * Plant won't intersect with other built structures (buildings)
      * If area intersects with other plants this could negatively impact the health of it and its neighboring plants

### Ideas

* Transplanting significant plants at the Mayor's discretion, i.e. _Zone Restrictions_
  * Policies in place city-wide and zone-specific that govern when and how plants are destroyed or transplanted

**Questions**

- Should uprooted plants instead be transported to landfills or sent for processing?
- Maybe there's an industry for _Biomass Recycling_?
