# Foliage Rendering

## Prior Art & Inspiration

## Philosophy

* A plant is always growing, unless:
  * It is currently [Dormant](../lifecycle#dormancy), or
  * It is [Dead](../lifecycle#death)
* Each stage of [Growth](../lifecycle#growth) is distinct
* Growing plants have different heights, shapes, and colors.

A plant in good health is visually distinct from an unhealthy or dying plant

* Trunks and branches are solid brown (duh üòù)
* Leaves and stems are green (also duh üòù)
* Flowers vary in color
  * Usually the same color for a single plant

Use varying shades of brown and green in the same and for different plants to give the city some visual panache

### Dying and Dead Plants

#### Dying ([Unhealthy](../health))

* Dying trees, shrubs, and bushes will begin to lose their leaves and change color
* Dying conifers' needles turn brown then begin to fall off

#### Dead

* Dead trees, shrubs, and bushes lose all their leaves
* Dead conifers' needles are brown and have fallen off

### Questions

* How is a dead plant's color distinct from a healthy or dying plant?
* Do we render fallen dead leaves?
