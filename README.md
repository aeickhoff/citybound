This repository contains the code of Citybound, and also a detailed **Design Doc**, describing the philosophy and decisions taken for design and implementation. It is interwoven with the code - to make clear, which parts of the game are implemented where. Just follow the link below to get started.

**Both code and the Design Doc are open for contribution.** You can suggest changes by making a pull request, which can be discussed and refined before deciding if it will be taken fully, partially, or not - documenting both decision and implementation processes publicly.
