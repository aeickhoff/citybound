//! `Kay` is a high-performance actor system, suitable for simulating millions of entities.
//!
//! In `Kay`, actors concurrently send and receive asynchronous messages, but are
//! otherwise completely isloated from each other. Actors can only mutate their own state.
//!
//! Have a look at [`Actor`](trait.Actor.html), [`Recipient`](trait.Recipient.html)
//! and [`Swarm`](swarm/struct.Swarm.html) to understand the main abstractions.
